<h1>Audience Engagement Work</h1>

<p>The Columbia Missourian, a community news organization managed by professional editors and staffed by Missouri School of Journalism students.</p>

<p><strong>Election Alert Newsletter</strong> In this audience project, I worked with a group to put together a weekly newsletter meant to inform and engage voters ahead of the General Municipal Election. This newsletter served as a form of service journalism, answering frequently asked questions about the upcoming election, providing summaries of forums and candidate profiles, as well as linking to reporting from The Missourian itself.</p>
